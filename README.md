# Project Description


This project is about analyzing the ridership of the buses in the Champaign-Urbana area operated by the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District also known as CUMTD. CUMTD buses are commonly used by not only the people living in the Champaign and Urbana areas, but students who attend University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and Parkland College. The public transportation system helps students get around the large campus area. From students majoring in engineering and minoring in business who need to go from Grainger College of Engineering to Gies College of Business, to students who need to attend conferences at I-Hotel and many more.
